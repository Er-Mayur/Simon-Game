Simon Game  
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. The game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order as it becomes progressively more difficult with each level.

How It Works:  
Start the Game: Press any key on the keyboard to start the game.  
Game Mechanics: The game begins with a random color flashing on the screen. Players need to repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding colored buttons. With each successful round, the sequence gets longer by one additional random color.  
Scoring: The game tracks the level, which increases as you correctly follow the sequence.  
Game Over: If a player clicks the wrong color, the game ends, and an alert appears. The player can restart the game by pressing any key.    


Features:  
Dynamic level tracking  
Visual and audio feedback for each color press  
Game over animation and sound effects  
Automatic sequence generation with increasing difficulty  


Technologies Used:  
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the game interface.  
JavaScript/jQuery: For game logic, event handling, and animations.  
Audio: Integrated sound effects to enhance the user experience.
